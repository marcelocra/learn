# Two Fer

Welcome to Two Fer on Exercism's F# Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Introduction

In some English accents, when you say "two for" quickly, it sounds like "two fer".
Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free.
So the phrase "two-fer" often implies a two-for-one offer.

Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!").
You've gone for the offer and (very generously) decided to share the extra cookie with a friend.

## Instructions

Your task is to determine what you will say to your friend as you hand them their cookie.

If your friend is named Do-yun, then you will say:

```text
One for Do-yun, one for me.
```

On the other hand, if for some reason you can't remember your friend's name just then, you'll say _you_ instead of their name:

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

|Name    |Dialogue
|:-------|:------------------
|Alice   |One for Alice, one for me.
|Bohdan  |One for Bohdan, one for me.
|        |One for you, one for me.
|Zaphod  |One for Zaphod, one for me.
