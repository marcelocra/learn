# Conjure help commands
Lets memorize them!

Everything should be prepended by <localleader>:

- evaluate buffer: eb
- show log horiz: ls
- show log vert: lv
- show log new tab: lt
- close log view: lq
- reset log view:
    - soft (erase): lr
    - hard (close window, delete buffer): lR
- evaluate inner form: ee
- evaluate outermost form: er
- evaluate and replace form with result: e!
- evaluate mark: emf (if mark was set for f)
- evaluate contents of variable under cursor: ew
- evaluate visual selection: E
- use motions to evaluate: Eiw (inner word) or Ea( (around parens)

That's it!
